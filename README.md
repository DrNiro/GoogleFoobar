# Google foobar

This repository includes my accepted solutions from Google foobar challenge, written in python.

### What is Google foobar?
  
Google foobar is a hidden coding challange by Google. The challenge consists of 9 questions in 5 levels of increasing difficulty.
You have to either get invited by Google while browsing related sites, or by an invite directly from someone who is already participating in the challenge.
Each question has a fair amount of time to submit and the solution must pass all test cases, including hidden test cases, in order to proceed to the next one.
You can choose writting a solution in Python or Java.
Questions are varying between participants, and are presented as a plot with an amusing lore.
