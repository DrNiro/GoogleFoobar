    "Elevator versions are represented by a series of numbers, divided up into major, minor and revision integers. New versions of an elevator increase the major number, e.g. 1, 2, 3, and so on. When new features are added to an elevator without being a complete new version, a second number named \"minor\" can be used to represent those new additions, e.g. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc. Small fixes or maintenance work can be represented by a third number named \"revision\", e.g. 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.0, and so on. The number zero can be used as a major for pre-release versions of elevators, e.g. 0.1, 0.5, 0.9.2, etc (Commander Lambda is careful to always beta test her new technology, with her loyal henchmen as subjects!).\n",

The versions in list l will always contain major numbers, but minor and revision numbers are optional. If the version contains a revision number, then it will also have a minor number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the list l as [\"1.1.2\", \"1.0\", \"1.3.3\", \"1.0.12\", \"1.0.2\"], the function answer(l) would return the list [\"1.0\", \"1.0.2\", \"1.0.12\", \"1.1.2\", \"1.3.3\"]. If two or more versions are equivalent but one version contains more numbers than the others, then these versions must be sorted ascending based on how many numbers they have, e.g [\"1\", \"1.0\", \"1.0.0\"].

It looks like a chessboard, and every morning and evening you have to solve a new movement puzzle in order to cross the floor. That would be fine if you got to be the rook or the queen, but instead, you have to be the knight. Worse, if you take too much time solving the puzzle, you get \"volunteered\" as a test subject for the LAMBCHOP doomsday device!\n",

    "You're awfully close to destroying the LAMBCHOP doomsday device and freeing Commander Lambda's bunny prisoners, but once they're free of the prison blocks, the bunnies are going to need to escape Lambda's space station via the escape pods as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the halls of the space station are a maze of corridors and dead ends that will be a deathtrap for the escaping bunnies. Fortunately, Commander Lambda has put you in charge of a remodeling project that will give you the opportunity to make things a little easier for the bunnies. Unfortunately (again), you can't just remove all obstacles between the bunnies and the escape pods - at most you can remove one wall per escape pod path, both to maintain structural integrity of the station and to avoid arousing Commander Lambda's suspicions. \n",
    "You have maps of parts of the space station, each starting at a prison exit and ending at the door to an escape pod. The map is represented as a matrix of 0s and 1s, where 0s are passable space and 1s are impassable walls. The door out of the prison is at the top left (0,0) and the door into an escape pod is at the bottom right (w-1,h-1). \n",
    "Write a function answer(map) that generates the length of the shortest path from the prison door to the escape pod, where you are allowed to remove one wall as part of your remodeling plans. The path length is the total number of nodes you pass through, counting both the entrance and exit nodes. The starting and ending positions are always passable (0). The map will always be solvable, though you may or may not need to remove a wall. The height and width of the map can be from 2 to 20. Moves can only be made in cardinal directions; no diagonal moves are allowed."

You need to get the numerous bunnies through the various rooms to the escape pods. Unfortunately, the corridors between the rooms can only fit so many bunnies at a time. What's more, many of the corridors were resized to accommodate the LAMBCHOP, so they vary in how many bunnies can move through them at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the starting room numbers of the groups of bunnies, the room numbers of the escape pods, and how many bunnies can fit through at a time in each direction of every corridor in between, figure out how many bunnies can safely make it to the escape pods at a time at peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function solution(entrances, exits, path) that takes an array of integers denoting where the groups of gathered bunnies are, an array of integers denoting where the escape pods are located, and an array of an array of integers of the corridors, returning the total number of bunnies that can get through at each time step as an int. The entrances and exits are disjoint and thus will never overlap. The path element path[A][B] = C describes that the corridor going from A to B can fit C bunnies at each time step.  There are at most 50 rooms connected by the corridors and at most 2000000 bunnies that will fit at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have:\n",
    "entrances = [0, 1]\n",
    "exits = [4, 5]\n",
    "path = [\n",
    "  [0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0],  # Room 0: Bunnies\n",
    "  [0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0],  # Room 1: Bunnies\n",
    "  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4],  # Room 2: Intermediate room\n",

    "  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Room 5: Escape pods\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in each time step, the following might happen:\n",
    "0 sends 4/4 bunnies to 2 and 6/6 bunnies to 3\n",
    "1 sends 4/5 bunnies to 2 and 2/2 bunnies to 3\n",
    "2 sends 4/4 bunnies to 4 and 4/4 bunnies to 5\n",
    "3 sends 4/6 bunnies to 4 and 4/6 bunnies to 5\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in total, 16 bunnies could make it to the escape pods at 4 and 5 at each time step.  (Note that in this example, room 3 could have sent any variation of 8 bunnies to 4 and 5, such as 2/6 and 6/6, but the final solution remains the same.)\n",

    "You need to free the bunny workers before Commander Lambda's space station explodes! Unfortunately, the Commander was very careful with the highest-value workers -- they all work in separate, maximum-security work rooms. The rooms are opened by putting keys into each console, then pressing the open button on each console simultaneously. When the open button is pressed, each key opens its corresponding lock on the work room. So, the union of the keys in all of the consoles must be all of the keys. The scheme may require multiple copies of one key given to different minions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consoles are far enough apart that a separate minion is needed for each one. Fortunately, you have already relieved some bunnies to aid you - and even better, you were able to steal the keys while you were working as Commander Lambda's assistant. The problem is, you don't know which keys to use at which consoles. The consoles are programmed to know which keys each minion had, to prevent someone from just stealing all of the keys and using them blindly. There are signs by the consoles saying how many minions had some keys for the set of consoles. You suspect that Commander Lambda has a systematic way to decide which keys to give to each minion such that they could use the consoles.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to figure out the scheme that Commander Lambda used to distribute the keys. You know how many minions had keys, and how many consoles are by each work room.  You know that Command Lambda wouldn't issue more keys than necessary (beyond what the key distribution scheme requires), and that you need as many bunnies with keys as there are consoles to open the work room.\n",

    "Given the number of bunnies available and the number of locks required to open a work room, write a function solution(num_buns, num_required) which returns a specification of how to distribute the keys such that any num_required bunnies can open the locks, but no group of (num_required - 1) bunnies can.\n",

To cover all of the bunnies, the final solution is represented by a sorted list of each individual bunny's list of keys.

    " \n",
    "Problem is, to avoid detection by galactic law enforcement, Commander Lambda planted the space station in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field. In order to make the jump to hyperspace, you need to know the configuration of celestial bodies in the quadrant you plan to jump through. In order to do *that*, you need to figure out how many configurations each quadrant could possibly have, so that you can pick the optimal quadrant through which youll make your jump. \n",
    " \n",
    "There's something important to note about quasar quantum flux fields' configurations: when drawn on a star grid, configurations are considered equivalent by grouping rather than by order. That is, for a given set of configurations, if you exchange the position of any two columns or any two rows some number of times, youll find that all of those configurations are equivalent in that way -- in grouping, rather than order.\n",
    " \n",
    "Write a function solution(w, h, s) that takes 3 integers and returns the number of unique, non-equivalent configurations that can be found on a star grid w blocks wide and h blocks tall where each celestial body has s possible states. Equivalency is defined as above: any two star grids with each celestial body in the same state where the actual order of the rows and columns do not matter (and can thus be freely swapped around). Star grid standardization means that the width and height of the grid will always be between 1 and 12, inclusive. And while there are a variety of celestial bodies in each grid, the number of states of those bodies is between 2 and 20, inclusive. The solution can be over 20 digits long, so return it as a decimal string.  The intermediate values can also be large, so you will likely need to use at least 64-bit integers.\n",
